# Part 2 - Social Website

In Part Two of [Antonio Mele's Django 3 By Example](https://www.packtpub.com/product/django-3-by-example-third-edition/9781838981952), Antonio extends our grasp of Django further by develop a social/sharing website in three chapters.

## Chapter 4 - Building a Social Website

This chapter covers the following topics:

* Using the Django authentication framework
* Creating user registration views
* Extending the user model with a custom profile model
* Adding social authentication with Python Social Auth
The hardest part here was trying to get my URLs.py files and correcting my "no attribute "dashboard" error messages. Is entire class is a little advance for me and my understanding of Python.  It would be more helpful for me to do a line by line process, but the walkthrough videos were very helpful with more understand on the material and steps. 

## Chapter 5 - Sharing Content on Your Website

* Creating many-to-many relationships
* Customizing behavior for forms
* Using jQuery with Django
* Building a jQuery bookmarklet
* Generating image thumbnails using easy-thumbnails
* Implementing AJAX views and integrating them with jQuery
* Creating custom decorators for views
* Building AJAX pagination

This chapter was diffcult, and I will need more practice for understanding. 

## Chapter 6 - Tracking User Actions

* Building a follow system
* Creating many-to-many relationships with an intermediary model
* Creating an activity stream application
* Adding generic relations to models
* Optimizing QuerySets for related objects
* Using signals for denormalizing counts
* Storing item views in Redis
I could better under more to the backend coding during this chapter because at work there are different techiques we use to track our users on our ERP system. For me beginning a beginner to python I would need more better functions and techiques to better under stand the flow process of the coding , but once again the views were very helpful
